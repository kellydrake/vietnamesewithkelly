Welcome!

I created this website as a way to practice the foundations of web development: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, while also practicing the Vietnamese language!

You can access the website here: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Below is a breakdown of each page:
  - Home page: I included a welcome header with a CTA which will take users to the pronunciation page first. Since this site is all about learning a new language, I believe it's important to learn the alphabet and how to pronounce words before jumping into anything else.
  - Pronunciation page: On this page, I have a 20 minute video breaking down the Vietnamese pronunciation. 
  - Phrases page: On this page, you'll find basic phrases in Vietnamese with the English translation and an audio clip so you can hear the pronunciation.
  - Vocab page: On this page, I created flip cards using JavaScript where if you click on the card, it will turn 180 degrees revealing the English translation on the other side. It's like using flash cards to study vocabulary words.
  - About page: This page is just an intro about myself and why I created the site. 

Let me know if you have any questions! Thanks!
